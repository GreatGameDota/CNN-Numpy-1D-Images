# ConvNet Library using Numpy

Library inspired by Keras and TensorFlow  
Main math functions from Alejandro Escontrela's [Numpy CNN](https://github.com/Alescontrela/Numpy-CNN)  

---

Example CNN made to classify the MNIST data set  
Trained on 100 images randomly shuffled 100 times, training only took 35 minutes  
After training, model achieved <b>93.77%</b> accuracy on test data set

I also added a way to visualize how the example model works
